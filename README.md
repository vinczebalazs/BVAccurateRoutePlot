# BVAccurateRoutePlot

If you are using Google Maps in your application, and want to plot some directions on the map, you won't get an accurate polyline which follwos the road (especially for long distances). 

The reason for this is that Google Maps will only send you an "overview_polyine" which is just a rough estimate of where the polyline should be on the map. This can lead to weird results, such as the polyline being completely off the road.

**BVAccurateRoutePlot** solves this by using Google's Snap-To-Road API, to **correct the poyline**.

**Note:** **BVAccurateRoutePlot** uses Apple's MapKit for calculating directions, as it is much faster than Google's. 

**Please don't forget to link the `<MapKit>` framework to your project in Xcode!**

## **Usage**

Open the demo project, and copy the folder called **BVAccurateRoutePlot** to your own Xcode project. That's it! :)

## **Example**


``` smalltalk 

//Initilaize the route  plotter
BVAccurateRoutePlot *routePlotter = [[BVAccurateRoutePlot alloc] init];
        
//Set up some properties
routePlotter.strokeWidth = 6;
routePlotter.strokeColor = [UIColor blueColor];

[routePlotter drawRouteOnMap:mapView withStartPoint:[tappedCoordinates objectAtIndex:0] endPoint:[tappedCoordinates objectAtIndex:1]]; 
```
